# RecoveryBridge Session Summary

> **Historical snapshot — February 13, 2026. Not current state.**  
> A working session log.

**Date:** February 13, 2026  
**Session Type:** Bug Fixes, Code Review & UX Improvements

---

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. **Centered Disable Notifications Button**
- **Issue:** Disable button and success text weren't perfectly centered
- **Fix:** Changed parent div from `text-center` to `flex flex-col items-center text-center` in NotificationSettings.tsx
- **Location:** `components/NotificationSettings.tsx` (line 305)

### 2. **Removed Debug Console Logs**
Cleaned up all client-side console.log statements for production:

**Files Modified:**
- `components/AvailableListeners.tsx` - Removed realtime update log
- `components/ServiceWorkerRegistration.tsx` - Removed SW registration log
- `app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Removed 7 console.log statements:
  - Realtime subscription logs (INSERT/UPDATE events)
  - Session loading logs
  - Cleanup logs
  - Notification result logs
- `app/profile/page.tsx` - Removed admin delete fallback log

**Note:** Kept all `console.error()` statements as they're important for error tracking in production.

### 3. **Fixed Database Type Definition**
- **Issue:** PushSubscription type didn't match actual database schema
- **Previous:** Had `endpoint` and `keys` as separate fields
- **Fixed:** Changed to have `subscription` object containing `endpoint` and `keys`
- **Location:** `lib/types/database.ts` (lines 82-90)

This now matches the actual database structure where subscription data is stored as a single JSONB column.

### 4. **Comprehensive Code Review**
Reviewed all implementation files for the Always Available Mode feature:

✅ **NotificationSettings.tsx** (424 lines)
- Push notification enable/disable logic
- Always Available toggle
- PWA requirement enforcement
- All logic verified correct

✅ **NotificationInstructionsModal.tsx** (173 lines)
- Modal close handlers working correctly
- iOS installation instructions clear and complete

✅ **AvailableListeners.tsx** (218 lines)
- Correctly filters for `always_available` OR recent heartbeat
- Real-time subscription working
- Clean error handling

✅ **Database Types** (146 lines)
- `always_available: boolean` properly defined in Profile interface
- Included in ProfileUpdateData type
- PushSubscription type fixed to match schema

✅ **Constants** (91 lines)
- All time thresholds properly defined
- Helper functions clean and correct

### 5. **Build Test**
- **Result:** ✅ **SUCCESS**
- Build time: 2.2 seconds
- No TypeScript errors
- No linting errors
- All 20 routes generated successfully

## 🗂️ Current Feature Status

### Always Available Mode
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE & TESTED**

**How It Works:**
1. Listeners with push notifications enabled can toggle "Always Available"
2. When enabled, they stay marked as "Available" indefinitely (no 5-minute timeout)
3. AvailableListeners component shows users with:
   - `always_available = true` (always shown), OR
   - Recent heartbeat within 5 minutes
4. Badge indicator (⚡) shows who has Always Available enabled

**Requirements:**
- Must have push notifications enabled
- Only works in PWA mode
- Only available for listeners (allies/professionals)
