# RecoveryBridge Website Redesign
## Complete Content for Carrd.co

**Based on:** Current site at recoverybridge.app
**Approach:** Keep emotional photo, fix structure, add missing elements
**Goal:** Beta signups for people in recovery

---

## 🎨 DESIGN CHANGES

### Current Issues to Fix:
- ❌ Pink/beige background (not calming for recovery)
- ❌ No key info above fold (24/7, Free, How it works)
- ❌ Weak CTA ("Join Beta Below")
- ❌ No trust indicators or social proof
- ❌ FAQ buried at bottom
- ❌ Pricing confusion (says "affordable memberships")

### New Approach:
- ✅ Soft blue/grey background (calming, trustworthy)
- ✅ Key benefits visible immediately
- ✅ Strong, clear CTAs
- ✅ Trust badges and social proof
- ✅ Clear "Forever Free" messaging
- ✅ How It Works before FAQ

**Small Trust Badges (above headline):**
Display as small rounded pills with icons:

```
🔒 100% Private  |  ✨ Always Free  |  🌙 24/7 Support
```

**Main Headline:**
```
You don't have to go through recovery alone.
```
*(Keep this - it's powerful and working)*

**Subheadline:**
```
Connect 1:1 with peers who truly understand — whenever you need it most.
```

**Body Copy:**
```
RecoveryBridge isn't therapy or a hotline. It's real people in recovery, showing up for each other. Anonymous, encrypted, and always available.
```

**Two CTA Buttons (side by side):**

**Button 1 (Primary - Blue):**
```
Get Support Now →
```
- Background: Blue gradient `#2196F3` to `#1976D2`

THE CHALLENGE
```

Recovery has gaps. We fill them.

The hardest moments don't happen during meetings or therapy sessions. They happen at 2 AM. Between appointments. When you're alone and struggling.

Traditional support isn't always there when you need it:
```

**4 Pain Points (in a 2x2 grid or list):**

```
😔 Meetings have schedules
💰 Therapy is expensive
📞 Hotlines feel impersonal
🤷 Friends don't always understand
```

**Closing line:**
```
You need someone who's been there. Right now. Not tomorrow.
```

2. **Collect feedback:** Add a simple "Was this helpful?" at bottom of FAQ

3. **Track conversions:** Use Google Analytics to see where people drop off

4. **Iterate quickly:** Change one thing at a time and measure results

5. **Show real numbers:** As beta grows, update stats ("50+ members" becomes "200+ members")
